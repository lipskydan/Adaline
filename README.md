# Adaline
### Adaptive Linear Neuron by Python

This repository has two realisation of Adaline - **AdalineGD** and **AdalineSGD**.

The main difference is using different gradient descents. 
**AdalineGD** uses *Batch Gradient Descent* - weights are updated based on the sum of accumulated 
errors over all Xi samples.
**AdalineGD** uses *Stochastic Gradient Descent* - we update weights gradually for each training sample.

### Problem statement 
Determine the type of iris (setosa or versicolor) by the length of the sepal and the length of the petal.

### Dataset
Dataset is file 'iris.data'. Each realisation has this file in root.
